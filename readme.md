# Text-Summarization-Extractive-and-Abstractive
In this assignment, the performance of different text summarization methods is compared when applied on a set of 15 articles of our choice. The articles are taken from Wikipedia and they belong to different categories.


For extractive summarization methods, LSA based, TextRank and TF-IDF methods are used. 
For abstractive summarization, 02 Hugging face models Google/Pegasus-large and Facebook/Bart-large-cnn aare used.


ROUGE-2 scores and cosine similarity matrices are used as evaluation metrics to compare the accuracies between different summarization methods.
